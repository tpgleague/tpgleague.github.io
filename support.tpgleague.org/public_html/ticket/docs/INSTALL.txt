INTRODUCTION

ST4NK! Ticket is a simple support ticket system that uses the PHP scripting language and the MYSQL database server.
It has been developed and tested under Windows XP using EasyPHP version 1.8 and under FreeBSD version 5.3 using Apache 1.3.33,
PHP 4.3.10 and MYSQL 3.23.58.  ST4NK! Ticket should work in a Microsoft IIS environment, but it has not been tested.

INSTALLATION

ST4NK! Ticket requires the use of a MYSQL database and you will need to create a database or have one created for you.  In either case,
you will need to know:

The name of the database
The name of the user who will own the database
The password for the database user

The ST4NK! Ticket package has an sql subdirectory where there is a st4nkticket.sql file that needs to be inserted into your database.
You will either have to do this yourself via the mysql command line interface, phpMyAdmin or have your server admin do it for you.

1) Unzip or untar the st4nkTicket package on your client machine.
2) Edit the db.inc.php file in your favorite edit and replace the default database, user and password fields with your information.
3) Save your changes to the db.inc.php file.
4) Start an FTP session with your webserver and upload all files to your webserver root.
5) Insert the st4nkTicket.sql file (found in the sql directory) into your database.
6) Open your web browser and go to your ST4NK! Ticket website.  Examples:

http://www.yourdomain.com/st4nkticket/

OR

http://www.somedomain.com/~myaccount/st4nkticket

Whatever, you get the idea.  If things have worked out correctly you should see your ST4NK! Ticket website up and ready for use. Login
as 'Admin' with password 'admin'.  BE SURE TO CREATE ANOTHER USER WITH LEVEL 5 ADMIN ACCESS THEN EITHER DELETE THE ADMIN ACCOUNT
OR CHANGE THE PASSWORD.
