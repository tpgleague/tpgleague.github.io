TPG League

This is the source code to the TPG League website.

What's missing to make the site run?
1. A site that can execute PHP
2. The database schema and data. Schema can probably be manually recreated by looking at the queries in the code.
3. SMTP server, so that automated emails can be sent out
4. File hosting and the files that lived at files.tpgleague.org that were over 25 MB
5. Some links might be broken especially if the subdomain structure is not kept intact (www, backend, support, and files)
